# Prime Numbers
This project is an early Python project I created to solve puzzles 7 and 10 from Project Euler. Beyond solving the problems, I used this project as an opportunity to develop my ability to organize code in a clean and efficient manner. I also took the time to develop unit tests for this project. This helped expose to the basics of automated testing which is a skill many computer science programs and online tutorials overlook. I feel that the knowledge I gained about automated testing from this project will help me stand out as a candidate for developer positions.

There are several improvements that could be made to this project, particularly in the algorithm used to calculate the prime factorization of a number. My algorithm works for modestly large numbers, but the calculation is inefficient for very large numbers. I would like to revamp this algorithm and see if I can get it below O(n).
