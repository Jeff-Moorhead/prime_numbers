# Prime Numbers
This project is an early Python project I created to solve puzzles 7 and 10 from Project Euler. Beyond solving the problems, I used this project as an opportunity to develop my ability to organize code in a clean and efficient manner. I also took the time to develop unit tests for this project. This helped expose to the basics of automated testing and allowed me to ensure that all of code works as intended.

There are several improvements that could be made to this project, particularly in the algorithm used to calculate the prime factorization of a number. My algorithm works for modestly large numbers, but the calculation is inefficient for very large numbers. I would like to revamp this algorithm and see if I can get it below O(n).
